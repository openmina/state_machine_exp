// state or the states of their dependencies (other models) from the main
// `State`. This trait relies on runtime type information (RTTI) to correctly
// identify and return a reference to the desired field in Substates.
//
// Models are defined in terms of their own state type, and each Model's state
// is a field in the `Substates` struct, which is defined by the top-most Model.
// This struct must contain one field for every Model dependency (for
// Pure/InputModels only).
//
// The `ModelState` trait might seem a bit complicated, but it's a crucial
// part of this state-machine setup. It provides flexibility and helps keep
// things organized. In simple terms, it allows different parts of our program
// (the models) to access and manage their own specific data (state) within the
// larger system (the state-machine). This trait makes it easier to add,
// remove, or change parts of the system without disrupting the whole thing.
//
// A derive macro is provided, which simplifies a lot of the work for us.
// This macro automates the process of implementing the `ModelState` trait for
// a struct. The macro iterates over all named fields. For each field, it
// generates code that tries to downcast the field to the requested type (T).
// If the downcast succeeds, it returns a reference (or mutable reference) to
// the field. If the downcast fails, it proceeds to the next field.
