// `PRNGState` is an implementation of `PureModel` specifically used for
// managing the state of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).
//
// The model supports only one action, `Reseed`, which reseeds the PRNG with a
// provided `seed` parameter. While this action is available, it's not
// typically necessary to use it. Instead, Models can (and should) access the
// `PRNGState` directly through the `ModelState` interface.
//
// IMPORTANT: This implementation is designed for a fast and deterministic PRNG
// primarily intended for testing purposes. It should NOT be used for
// operations requiring cryptographic security due to its determinism and lack
// of cryptographic strength.
//
// TODO: implement a safe RNG (`EffectfulModel`).
