// `MioAction` is an enum representing various I/O related operations
// that can be performed. These actions are dispatched for handling by the
// `MioState` model. Each action variant includes the necessary parameters
// for the operation and a callback `Redispatch` to dispatch the result
// of the operation back to the caller Model.
//
// Operations include:
// - Poll creation, registration, and deregistration.
// - TCP server and connection management: listen, accept, connect, close.
// - Data transmission over TCP: write, read.
// - Miscellaneous: event creation, polling events, getting peer address.
//
// Note: `Uid` is used to uniquely identify instances of various Model-
// specific objects like polls, connections, events etc.
